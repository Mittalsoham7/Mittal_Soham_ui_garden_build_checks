INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING AND DEMONSTRATING THE COMPONENT LIBRARY PROJECT

This document provides step-by-step instructions for professors to run, test, and evaluate the mittal_soham_ui_garden component library project.

PREREQUISITES:
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Git (for version control)

STEP 1: CLONE AND SETUP THE PROJECT
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/mittal_soham_ui_garden.git
   cd mittal_soham_ui_garden

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

STEP 2: RUN CODE QUALITY CHECKS
1. Run linting:
   npm run lint
   (This will check for code style issues using ESLint)

2. Run code formatting:
   npm run format
   (This will format all TypeScript/React files using Prettier)

STEP 3: RUN TESTS
1. Run the test suite:
   npm run test
   (This will run all component tests using Vitest and show results)

2. Expected output: "Test Files 16 passed (16), Tests 34 passed (34)"

STEP 4: BUILD THE PROJECT
1. Build Storybook for production:
   npm run build-storybook
   (This creates a production build in the storybook-static directory)

STEP 5: RUN STORYBOOK LOCALLY
1. Start Storybook development server:
   npm run storybook
   (This starts Storybook on http://localhost:6006)

2. Open browser and navigate to http://localhost:6006
3. Browse through all 13 components and their stories
4. Test the controls for text color and background color

STEP 6: DOCKER DEPLOYMENT
1. Build the Docker image:
   docker build -t mittal_soham_ui_garden .

2. Run the container:
   docker run -d -p 8083:80 --name mittal_soham_ui_garden_container mittal_soham_ui_garden

3. Access the production Storybook at http://localhost:8083

STEP 7: VERIFY PRE-COMMIT HOOKS
1. Make a small change to any .tsx file (e.g., add a comment)
2. Try to commit:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test commit"
3. The pre-commit hook should run lint, format, and test automatically
4. If any checks fail, the commit will be blocked

STEP 8: GITHUB ACTIONS CI/CD
1. Push changes to the GitHub repository
2. Go to the "Actions" tab in GitHub
3. Verify that the CI workflow runs on push/PR
4. The workflow will run: install, lint, format, test, build-storybook
5. If any step fails, the build will fail and you'll be notified
